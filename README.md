# All my cheatsheets app

I usually have problems to remember common aliases or keybindings, so for learn React and new frontend libraries like Tailwind I decided to create my ideal cheatsheet apps.

---------

You can see my developer route in the new [Project Boards of Github](https://github.com/users/pabman11/projects/1/views/4) and Live App in [https://cheatsheet-pabman11.vercel.app/](https://cheatsheet-pabman11.vercel.app/) .

----------

## How is the content received?

All the content is in [src/documents](https://github.com/pabman11/cheatsheet/tree/main/src/documents) directory.

First, the app list all files in that directory and get the content.
